// Saturn V —— Stage III
//
// Saturn Five Stage Three ties together stage one and stage two by adding the necessary resets and more complex patterns.
// in this final stage, you'll finally see styles that will compile into CSS and design decisions wrapped in more complex mixins
// such as buttons, links, form fields, and more.


// Stage 3 builds on and necessitates Stage 2
@import 'stage-02';

// Reset - these are styles that establish some norms such as spacing, accessibility tags, and more
@import 'resets/base';
@import 'resets/a11y';

// Complex Patterns - These are still being styled but will include things like buttons, links, form fields, and more.
